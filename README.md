## Folders

This repository contains multiple folders that correspond to different lessons of the course.
There is a folder for each lesson that requires code changes.
There are 2 subfolders in each folder:

1. `begin` subfolder contains the state of the repository before the beginning of the lesson.
1. `end` subfolder contains the state of the repository at the end of the lesson.

Let's take as an example *"Minifying Images"* lesson.
There is a folder associated with it called *"6.3-minifying-images"*.
1. *6.3-minifying-images/begin*. You can cd to this subfolder right before starting the lesson and repeat all the steps from the lesson while watching it.
2. *6.3-minifying-images/end*. If you want to see how the application looks like at the end of this lesson, you can cd to this subfolder.

Don't forget to run ```npm install``` after switching between folders.
- ```cd /path/to/repository/6.3-minifying-images/begin```
- ```npm install```
